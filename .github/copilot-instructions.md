### Database Design
- **Seasons Table**: Track seasonal periods and status
- **Divisions Table**: Store division data with points, ranks, levels
- **Season History**: Archive past season performance
- **Point Updates**: Audit trail for all point changes
- **Admin Users**: Secure admin account management

## Quick Start Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb leaderboard_db
   
   # Update .env file with your database credentials
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy and edit environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Backend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Frontend dependencies
   cd client && npm install && cd ..
   ```

4. **Start Development Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Start both backend and frontend
   npm run dev:both
   
   # Or start separately:
   # npm run dev        (backend only)
   # npm run client     (frontend only)
   ```

5. **Access Application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - Admin Login: admin / admin123

## Development Guidelines

### Frontend Development
- Components use Tailwind CSS for styling
- API calls handled through centralized service layer
- Authentication managed with React Context
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Backend Development
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
- Database operations use parameterized queries
- Authentication with JWT tokens
- Error handling and logging throughout

### Database Operations
- Automatic table creation on first run
- Seasonal data archival before resets
- Point update audit trail
- Rank recalculation after point changes

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Production Database**: Set up production PostgreSQL instance
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure production environment variables
3. **Build Process**: Run `npm run build` for production build
4. **Domain Configuration**: Update CORS settings for production domain
5. **SSL Certificate**: Configure HTTPS for production
6. **Process Manager**: Use PM2 or similar for production process management

## Support & Maintenance

- Monitor seasonal resets via cron job logs
- Regular database backups recommended
- Update JWT secrets for production
- Monitor API rate limiting effectiveness

The project is complete and ready for development/testing with proper database configuration.
